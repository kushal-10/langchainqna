Please also describe how do the authors claim these points.,2018Dong&Transchel&Hoberg etal - EJOR - An inventory control model for modal split transport.pdf,"  The  key  points  of  this  research  based  on  the  keyword  ""transportation""  are:
 1.  The  authors  propose  a  multimodal  transportation  (MST)  model  that  takes  into  account  the  volume-dependent  transportation  cost.
 2.  The  MST  model  is  a  new  approach  to  freight  mode  choice  that  takes  into  account  the  volume-dependent  transportation  cost.
 3.  The  MST  model  is  based  on  the  freight  mode  choice  literature  and  the  dual-sourcing  literature,  which  both  study  similar  problems  with  multiple  suppliers  but  have  a  similar  mathematical  structure.
 4.  The  authors  provide  numerical  results  that  highlight  the  error  of  their  approximation  and  the  potential  volume  split  for  both  modes.
 5.  The  authors  also  present  a  model  extension  that  considers  volume-dependent"
