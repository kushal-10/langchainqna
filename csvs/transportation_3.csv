 1.  The  authors  propose  a  dual  sourcing  inventory  model  for  modal  split  transport,  which  involves  a  company  sourcing  goods  from  both  road  and  rail  transport  modes.
 2.  The  model  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  fixed  cost  of  rail  transport  drives  its  delivery  cycle  and  quantity,  and  the  delivery  cycle  and  quantity  of  rail  transport  impact  the  base  stock  controls  of  road  transport.
 3.  The  authors  claim  that  the  change  in  K  is  particularly  important  because  it  will  tactically  impact  the  entire  decision  of  both  rail  and  road  transport  controls.
 4.  The  authors  also  present  the  sensitivity  and  robustness  of  the  MST  model.
 5.  The  authors  also  discuss  the  literature  on  the  shift  of  freight  volume  from  road  to  rail  transport  and  its  economic  and  environmental  importance.
