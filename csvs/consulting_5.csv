These  pitfalls  include  a  lack  of  value-creation  identification,  strategy,  and  road  map,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  internal  alignment,  as  well  as  a  struggle  to  build  a  compelling  case  for  the  investment.  Additionally,  companies  often  overlook  the  design  phase  and  do  not  focus  on  impact  focus  and  execution  rigor,  leading  to  suboptimal  choices  and  value  leakage.  Additionally,  companies  often  lack  capability  building  and  change  management,  which  can  lead  to  a  lack  of  full  value  capture.  The  survey  found  that  more  than  60%  of  recent  projects  were  delivered  either  late  or  over  budget.  These  pitfalls  can  be  avoided  by  focusing  on  value-creation  identification,  strategy,  and  road  map,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  internal  alignment,  as  well  as  a  struggle  to  build  a  compelling  case  for  the  investment.  Additionally,  companies  should  ensure  that  they  have  a  clear  design  phase  and  focus  on  impact  focus  and  execution  rigor,  as  well  as  adequate  capability  building  and  change  management.  By  addressing  these  pitfalls,  companies  can  avoid  the  common  challenges  of  planning  transformation  projects  being  late  or  over  budget.
