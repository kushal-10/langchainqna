Please also describe how do the authors claim these points.,2018Dong&Boute&McKinnon&Verelst - TRD - investigating synchromodality from a supply chain perspective.pdf,"  The  key  points  of  this  research  based  on  the  keyword  ""transportation""  are:
 1.  Synchromodality  research  is  still  in  its  early  stage.  The  number  of  publications  however  is  growing  as  shown  in  Fig.  3  .
 2.  The  majority  of  the  studies  are  exploratory  and  qualitative  in  nature,  which  is  not  surprising  for  an  emerging  concept.  The  first  quantitative  study  was  found  only  in  2015.  In  2016  three  more  quantitative  studies  were  published.  The  emergence  of  quantitative  studies  indicates  a  deepening  understanding  of  the  concept  and  growing  interest  in  its  implementation.
 3.  Until  now  the  synchromodality  concept  is  largely  defined  in  transportation  terms  and  logistics  service  providers  (LSPs)  modated  by  direct  trucking.
 The  authors  claim  these  points  by  reviewing  the  literature  on  synchromodality  and  analyzing  the  definition  and  advantages  of  the  concept  in  24  articles  written  in  English.  They  also  claim  that  the  majority  of  the  studies  are  exploratory  and  qualitative  in  nature,  which  is  not  surprising  for  an  emerging  concept.  The  first  quantitative  study  was  found  only  in  2015  and  in  2016  three  more  quantitative  studies  were  published.  The  emergence  of  quantitative  studies  indicates  a  deepening  understanding  of  the  concept  and  growing  interest  in  its  implementation.
