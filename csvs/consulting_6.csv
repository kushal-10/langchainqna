0,What are the key findings of this report? Explain in detail please.,Accenture2021 - SC analytics &AI.pdf,"  The  key  findings  of  this  report  are  that  a  small  group  of  companies  are  excelling  at  simultaneously  delivering  relevance,  resilience,  and  responsibility.  These  companies  are  significantly  outperforming  Others  in  overall  financial  performance,  as  measured  by  EBITDA  and  enterprise  value.  The  key  to  this  success  is  the  use  of  advanced  analytics  and  AI.  These  companies  are  adopting  these  powerful  tools  at  scale  and  are  leveraging  internal  data  (e.g.,  from  supply  chain  and  trade),  external  data  (e.g.,  consumption  data,  mobility,  macroeconomic  factors,  brand  sentiments,  weather,  and  COVID-19  cases),  and  advanced  algorithms  to  forecast  consumption  at  a  customer  level  and  shipment  at  a  location  level.  This  new  approach  enables  organizations  to  establish  a  unified  view  of  demand  and  a  repeatable  planning  process  that  enhances  accuracy  and  yields  new  insights  to  drive  more  meaningful  decisions  across  the  business.  By  leveraging  this  new  approach,  organizations  are  better  positioned  to  meet  demand,  avoid  being  surprised  by  disruptions  or  changes  in  conditions,  and  even  eliminate  unnecessary  shipments  and,  thus,  fuel  use  and  emissions.
