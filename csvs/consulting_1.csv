It  can  also  help  overcome  the  traditional  shortcomings  of  a  complex  cloud  transformation  project  by  validating  the  decisions  made  along  the  way.  The  TOM  includes  several  approaches  and  technology  solutions  that  can  provide  precision  visibility  into  supply  chains,  such  as  advanced  tracking  and  tracing,  predictive  analytics,  cognitive  decision  centers,  and  intelligent  automation.  It  also  includes  tracking  KPIs,  process  performance  indicators,  and  enhanced  reporting  beyond  the  vendor  supplied  reports.  The  report  also  addresses  governance,  service  delivery  model,  and  risks  involved  in  the  supply  chain  process.
