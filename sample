Synchromodality paper

What is the motivation, the methodology and the results of this research? What are the key points of this research?

The motivation of this research is to fill a research gap in the existing literature on synchromodality. The methodology used is a review of the current literature on synchromodality and the results are a list of 24 articles written in English that elaborate on the concept of synchromodality. The key points of this research are that synchromodality research is still in its early stage, the majority of the studies are exploratory and qualitative in nature, and the concept is largely defined in transportation terms and logistics service providers (LSPs). The research also aims to broaden the focus of multimodal research from the transportation system to the supply chain and contribute to the existing literature on the following two points: first, this study broadens the focus of multimodal research from the transportation system to the supply chain by reviewing the development of direct trucking.


What are the key points of this research? How do the authors arrive at these points and what is the impact of these points?
Key points of this research are:

    Synchromodality research is still in its early stage. The number of publications is growing as shown in Fig. 3.
    The majority of studies are exploratory and qualitative in nature, which is not surprising for an emerging concept. The first quantitative study was found only in 2015. In 2016 three more quantitative studies were published. The emergence of quantitative studies indicates a deepening understanding of the concept and growing interest in its implementation.
    Until now the synchromodality concept is largely defined in transportation terms and logistics service providers (LSPs) modated by direct trucking. The authors arrive at these points by reviewing the current literature on synchromodality and analyzing the current state-of-the-art. They also aim to broaden the focus of multimodal research from the transportation system to the supply chain and contribute to the existing literature on the following two points. The impact of these points is that they broaden the focus of multimodal research from the transportation system to the supply chain and contribute to the existing literature on the following two points. This research is important because it fills a research gap and contributes to the existing literature on the following two points.

    Until now the synchromodality concept is largely defined in transportation terms and logistics service providers (LSPs) modated by direct trucking. The authors arrive at these points by reviewing the literature on synchromodality in transportation. They used the keywords "synchromodality" and "synchromodal transportation" to search for articles written in English that elaborate on the concept of synchromodality. They also reviewed the evolution of modal split research from multimodality and intermodality to synchromodality.
